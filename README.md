# IPLC-Compiler
Makes an executable which can be used to produce assembly code for programs written in a specific (large enough) subset of C language which includes arrays, pointers, structs, functions calls, and loops among other basic features of C. 
The assembly is 32-bit x86 and can be converted to an executable using gnu
